Recordio actually understands your web app. It detects when you're typing, scrolling, or hovering over a card, and uses advanced algorithms to perfectly frame the important elements. It's also the only recorder that automatically spotlights cards, popovers, and other elements you interact with, giving your videos a polished, studio-quality look."
